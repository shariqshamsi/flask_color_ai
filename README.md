# flask_color_ai
 Flask_color_ai is a dynamic color palette generator project built using Flask framework, OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to input simple prompts, such as "generate google brand colors," into a search bar. Based on the prompt, the application generates a corresponding color palette in the background along with its respective color codes. Users can conveniently copy these color codes to their clipboard for use in their projects or designs.
